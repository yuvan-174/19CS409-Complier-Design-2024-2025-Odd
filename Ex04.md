## AIM   
To write a lex program to implement lexical analyzer to recognize a few patterns.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Lex program consists of three parts.
    a.	Declaration %%
    b.	Translation rules %%
    c.	Auxilary procedure.
3.	The declaration section includes declaration of variables, maintest, constants and regular definitions.
4.	Translation rule of lex program are statements of the form
    a.	P1 {action}
    b.	P2 {action}
    c.	…
    d.	…
    e.	Pn {action}
5.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
6.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l $ cc lex.yy.c
7.	Compile that file with C compiler and verify the output.
